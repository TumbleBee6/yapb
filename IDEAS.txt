Maybe a waypoint flag (or zone?) for turning off lights when camping a room?
Zones that help with teamplay and communication?
A more advanced Get in Position command? (using zones?)
Better peeking?
Fixed darkness behavior that updates so that turning off lights works?
Bot leaders fixed and improved?
Improved combat behavior?
Generally better teamwork?
Better flashbang/grenade usage? (Such as throwing flashbangs hostage rooms or corridors, or NOT THROWING HE'S AT THE HOSTAGES IN CRACKHOUSE!!)
