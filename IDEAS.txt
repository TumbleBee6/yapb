Maybe a waypoint flag (or zone?) for turning off lights when camping a room or randomly?
Zones that help with teamplay and communication? (like foxbot but maybe ALSO telling bots stuff to do there, maybe a chokepoint zone or rallypoint area for the Get In Position command? could help bot leaders)
A more advanced Get in Position command? (using zones or waypoint flags to set rallypoints?)
Better peeking?
Fixed darkness behavior and making it update so that turning off lights works (like in cs_mansion or cs_estate)
Bot leaders fixed and improved?
Improved combat and pre-combat behavior? (avoiding snipers if the bot doesn't have grenades or doesn't want to use them, avoid long range fights with shotguns and smgs, stopping before shooting with rifles, or rapidly strafing with SMG's, rushing closer to the enemy with shotguns and mac-10/tmp)
Generally better teamwork? (covering eachother and so on)
Better flashbang/grenade usage? (Such as throwing flashbangs hostage rooms or corridors, im also thinking of having bots use the experience stuff to throw grenades. NOT THROWING HIGH EXPLOSIVES AT THE HOSTAGES IN CRACKHOUSE!!)
Bots SOMETIMES buy weapons based on map/map ranges? (like buying more smg's and shotguns on cs_office or de_nuke, or more scoped rifles or snipers on maps like cs_desert)
Using cameras to report enemies in chat? (zones can help with this?)
Regroup team command making bots goto a waypoint set with a regroup point flag? (or just making them regroup somewhere like the area you gave the command, tho that might be too similar to the need backup and taking fire commands)
More stuff they can learn?
Improved follow behavior that makes them take a more tactical formation? maybe learned danger or the visibility table stuff can help?
