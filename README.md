## ☉ About
Server-side addon for computer controlled players (bots) for Counter-Strike b6.5 - 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. Bots allow you to play games without connecting to any game server or to the internet.

I want some more advanced teamplay, but since I can't code, this fork is stupid and dumb.
Theres an IDEAS file you can read if you want.
I have zero idea if any of them are possible. Probably aren't.
