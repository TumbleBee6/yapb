## ☉ About
It's a computer controlled players (bots) for the Counter-Strike b6.5 - 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. Bots allows you to play that games without connecting any game server or even without internet.

I want some more advanced teamplay, but since I can't code, this fork is stupid and dumb.
Theres an IDEAS file you can read if you want.
I have zero idea if any of them are possible. Probably aren't.
